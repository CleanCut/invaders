# Invaders

Invaders is an open source terminal arcade game with audio, based off of the "Space Invaders" classic arcade game.

This game was initially developed for a presentation at [OSCON Open Source Software Superstream Series: Live Codingâ€”Go, Rust, and Python](https://learning.oreilly.com/live-training/courses/oscon-open-source-software-superstream-series-live-codinggo-rust-and-python/0636920410188/) and then adapted for inclusion as an example project for the [Ultimate Rust Crash Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/ultimate-rust-crash-course/?referralCode=AF30FAD8C6CCCC2C94F0).  The tags `part-1`, `part-2`, etc. correspond to the various stages of the original presentation.

Since the original presentations, folks continue to tinker and improve the game. Feel free to fork this repository, make a change, and submit a pull request if you have a good idea!

### Sound Files

If you want the sound files, but don't want to clone the repository, here are all the sounds in two different archive formats (the sound files are the same):

- [sounds.zip](https://github.com/CleanCut/invaders/files/6312508/sounds.zip)
- [sounds.tar.gz](https://github.com/CleanCut/invaders/files/6312511/sounds.tar.gz)

### Dependencies on Linux

Audio should work out-of-the-box on macOS, Windows, and iOS.  For Linux, the
downstream package for actually _playing_ sound ([CPAL]) requires
the *Alsa* development libraries to be installed.

**CentOS**

```bash
sudo yum install -y alsa-lib-devel
```

**Debian/Ubuntu**

```bash
sudo apt install libasound2-dev pkg-config
```
